This directory contains a series of simple bash scripts that
demonstrate a variety of UNIX commands that are commonly used
in bioinformatics projects. 

Many of the scripts use the file called mail-list.txt for
demonstration purposes. There is also a file called 
mail-list-tab.txt that is similar to mail-list.txt, except
that it has tab delimiters rather than space delimiters.

Please examine each script and
learn about how the commands that are shown. After examine a
script, execute it using a command such as the following and
examine the output:

bash 1_cat_example.sh

Please let me know if you find any problems with these scripts.
